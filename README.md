# advent-of-code-2022

Let's do some advent of code! Here is the main site, try it out yourself: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

I'll be arranging each day's solution in folders, at least until that gets unweildly.

Will I even get back to updating the README anymore? Who knows??

----------------------------------------

Update! I did in fact stall on day 5. I may hopefully someday get back to this. 

It turns out my free time was taken up by getting the baby room ready for, well, the baby. Things I have learned while doing that:
- Not priming a paint job could potentially cause someone down the road to end up peeling your ceiling paint off in layers and wondering how/why this is possible. Thankfully this ceiling was popcorn style and we didn't really like that, but only really found out while trying to change a light fixture and the ceiling paint tore off..
- Spackle is not the same as joint compound.
- Spackle is probably better for fixing small holes, etc, as it is less pliable and dries quickly.
- Joint compound is better for smoothing out bad spots from either old sheetrock, bad mudding from previous folks, or bad mudding you did with spackle and didn't know it wouldn't really smooth/sand well.
- 120 grit sandpaper is much better for sanding the mudding (spackle or joint compound). A finer grit really just makes you go nuts and not appear that anything is working. Do be careful if you're on your "final" sand, however.
- Joint compound will possibly take multiple layers, and dries in ~24 hours (can be shortened by using say, a hairdryer). So plan that into your timing of your project.
- You really do probably want to put primer on bare/old drywall. Or any paint you don't quite want to have bleed through. We had paint (that supposedly had primer included) not stick in a couple spots and had to chip those down and patch with mud and paint again.
- Multiple coats of paint are going to be likely, even if you think it won't. The color will be truer if you do at least 2 coats. And you won't get the old color possibly "ghosting" through causing your color to look different than what you expected.
